# Website of the manufacturer of homemade ice cream

[Mighty Matcha](https://hje58raf.github.io/PP1-Mighty-Matcha)  is part of Code Institute's Milestone 1 Project: HTML/CSS Essentials. 
This is the website for Mighty Matcha, a fictional new ice cream shop in Co. Dublin. Dublin that specializes in homemade ice cream, using organic ingredients without artificial additives. The purpose of the website is to establish an online presence of the pastry shop as the main source of information for customers about the business.

The website is intended for people who want to buy homemade, fresh, high-quality ice cream. The website displays the products available to the user and provides the information needed to make a purchase at the ice cream shop..

# UX

## Project goals

* Making a static front-end site to present useful information to users/ customers, using all technologies that I have learned about so far. (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and user experience/design)
* Creating a website that is easy to navigate and easy to understand.
* The customer experience has to be great on every device and internet browser.
* I am creating a website for a home-made ice cream shop to offer them a unique and enjoyable experience
taste experience
* The website is intended for lovers of ice cream and organic products.

## User stories

### As the website and business owner I want to

* create an online presence for our ice cream shop.
* grow our local customer base
* inform existing and new customers about our produce, location, opening hours.
* to provide a method of contact for customers to order produce or ask questions.
* to provide some introductory information on our USP which is authentic ice cream.

### As a general user of the website/customer I want to

* find out the location, opening hours and contact information.
* order some produce for collection
* find out more about ice cream
* view all the produce and relevant information about each item.

## Design

I've chosen 2 primary colours for the backgrounds (#fdebe4), headings and footers (#d1e3fa). I tried to match the colors on the website with the colors used in the Mighty Matcha image

## Typography

The Lato and Roboto font is the main fonts used throughout the whole portfolio website. Sans Serif is the fallback in case the main font isn’t being imported to the site correctly. 

## Imagery

Images were downloaded from Pixabay and resized for the purpose of this website.

## Wireframes

# Features

## Existing Features

### Header navigation bar

The navigation bar is visible on all pages. They give access to the About, and Contact pages.
With a mobile device, the navbar is displayed in a hamburger menu.

### Footer

The footer is visible on all pages. Media links of Facebook, Instagram, Google, Linkedin, Github and Twitter.

### Home

On the home page, using a carousel, I presented our most famous ice creams. This page also contains the store's address and opening hours.

### About page

The company page displays basic information about business and ice cream production. The information is kept concise with short paragraphs so as not to overload the user with text and information but enough to answer initial questions and spark interest in the business and the products. 


### Contact page

My contact page is very simple so. There are input fields for a name, email address and a description of what the contact is concerning.

## Features left to implement in the future

As this project is designed to build a static front-end that demonstrates the skills I have developed using CSS3, HTML5 and Bootstrap technologies, In the future, I would like to upgrade the site with the ability to order and pay for products online. I would also like to allow visitors to rate the work.

## Browser compatibility

I tested the appearance  and responsiveness of 4 browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Edge) and it showed good results in all browsers.

## Test the Navigation Bar between Desktop and Mobile

Test the navigation bar collapses to give the 'hamburger' icon when the device is smaller than medium.

* Test Results

## Test the Footer

I placed the social media icons in the center of the footer. I tested all the links and they all worked well. The social media links each open in a separate tab.

## Navigation Testing

The menu options all open the correct page.


## Contact Page

When testing a page, the Name and Description fields allow input of any text while Email requires the input of Email form. I repeated the test several times and each time it was successful.

## About Page

The About page is divided into three sections showing representative works of my daughter with which I wanted to show her skills, creativity and competencies.

In the first section, there are Gifs and in the second there are animations. They are divided into three columns, on a tablet into two, on a cell phone into one.

In the third section are the Artworks that go from four columns to three and then to two on the cell phone.

# Testing user stories

## First-time visitors

    * The first visitor can open links to Facebook, linkedin... and get additional information..

## As a customer

# Credits

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. If you are using Gitpod then you need [this template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) instead.  We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Codeanywhere and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **August 30th, 2023**

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

---

Happy coding!
